    ###     method below using the padding character from the arguments. You should ensure all
    ###     sentences have the same number of words and each word has the same number of
    ###     characters.
    ###     Set padding words to a `max_word_length` sized vector of padding characters.
    ###
    ###     You should NOT use the method `pad_sents()` below because of the way it handles
    ###     padding and unknown words.
